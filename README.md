Professional code snippet management for WordPress, developed by [SPARKWEB Studio](https://sparkwebstudio.com/).

## Features

### Core Functionality
-   **Code Editor:** Integrated Ace Editor for enhanced code editing with syntax highlighting.
-   **Snippet Types**: Supports CSS, JavaScript, and PHP snippets.
-   **Default Snippets Package**: Pre-installed curated snippets for common use cases (can be extended via import/export).

-   **Import/Export**: Import and export default snippets as JSON files.

### Security

-   **Nonce Verification**: All AJAX actions are protected with nonces.
-   **Audit Logging**: Error tracking for security events (future enhancement).

### Performance

### Tools
