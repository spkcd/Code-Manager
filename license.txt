**Key Updates:**
1. Added version badge
2. Documented default snippets system
3. Detailed security measures
4. Performance optimizations list
5. Structured changelog with categories
6. Contribution guidelines
7. Updated screenshots references

To maintain this:
1. Update version number with each release
2. Add new features under appropriate sections
3. Document security enhancements immediately
4. Note performance impacts for major changes
5. Keep changelog in reverse chronological order

Would you like me to create separate documentation files for:
1. Security practices
2. Contributor guidelines
3. Translation handbook
